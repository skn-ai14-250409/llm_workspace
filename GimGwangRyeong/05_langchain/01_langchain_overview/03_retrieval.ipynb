다 읽어야 하는 것은 아닙니다. 모든 정책과 지침은 으레 다섯 원칙으로 요약되니까요.\\n위키백과에 고정 불변의 법칙은 없지만, 위키백과의 정책과 지침 문서에는 공동체가 지키자고 합의한 원칙과 모범 사례가 있습니다. 정책은 모든 사용자들이 일반적으로 따르는 규범이고, 지침은 보통 특정 상황에서 따르면 좋은 모범 사례를 뜻합니다. 정책과 지침은 항상

것입니다. 편집자들은 되도록이라면 상식적인 수준에서 지침을 따르는 것이 좋지만, 때때로 예외적인 상황에선 적용되지 않을 수도 있습니다. 위키백과의 지침 문서는 분류:위키백과 지침 분류에 모여 있습니다. 또한 주요 지침을 요약한 문서로 위키백과:지침 목록 문서도 참고할 수 있습니다.\\n수필 (essay)이란 광범위한 총의가 형성되지 않은 편집자 혼자, 혹은 편집자 무리의 경험과 의견, 자신만의 해석이나 조언을 모은 것입니다. 정책이나 지침처럼 전체적인 총의를 따르지도, 모든 사용자가 동의하는 내용도 아닐 수 있으며 다른 사람들의 동의 과정 없이도 작성하거나 변경할 수 있습니다. 수필 문서는 분류:위키백과 수필 분류에 모여 있습니다. (자세한 내용은 \\'위키백과:수필\\'을 참조하세요)\\n그 외에 위키백과와 위키프로젝트 이름 공간에 있는 문서의 종류에는 다음이 있습니다.\\n\\n정책과 지침을 용이하게 적용하기 위한 요청 및 토론 문서.(예를 들어 위키백과:삭제 토론이나 위키백과:관리자 요청이 있습니다)\\n위키프로젝트 내에서 특정 분야의 문서 작업 효율성 증가를 위해 만든 각종 조언과 자체적인 지침 문서.\\n위키백과를 사용하는 데 있어 사용 방법에 대한 정보를 얻거나 도움을 받을 수 있는 도움말과 설명문 문서.\\n위키백과에 대한 기능이나 전체적인 정보를 제공하는 정보문 문서.\\n정책과 지침을 보충하는 보조 자료 역할을 하는 보충 설명 문서.\\n공동체 내부 토의와 대화를 위한 토론 문서와 알림판 문서.\\n이러한 타 문서는 위키백과를 사용하는 데 도움이 될 유용한 정보나 조언이 있을 수 있지만 정책이나 지침에 해당되진 않습니다.\\n\\n준수\\n\\xa0위키백과:\"규칙에 얽매이지 말라\"는 말의 의미  문서를 참고하십시오.\\n정책과 지침을 해석하고 적용할 땐 항상 상식적으로 생각하여 적용해야 합니다. 규칙에는 가끔씩 예외가 있습니다. 하지만 이 말이 규칙을 무작정 어기거나 무시해도 괜찮다는 의미는 아닙니다. 규칙을 표면적으로는 지켰다고 할지라도, 규칙의 의도, 정신을 위배하는 사용자는 차단 혹은 제한 조치를 받을 수 있습니다.\\n정책이나 지침 문서의 특정 부분은 총의가 바뀌면서 제정 당시의 의미가 사라졌을 수도 있습니다. 반대로, 그 취지를 고려하지 않고 단순히 정책이나 지침에 적힌 그대로 행동한다고 해서 위키백과의 총의를 지키는 것은 아닙니다. 정책과 지침을 해석하고 적용할 때에는 상식과 총의를 기준으로, 즉 대부분의 사용자가 동의하는 해석과 정신으로 기여해 주세요.\\n\\n집행\\n\\xa0위키백과:관리자 및 위키백과:차단 정책  문서를 참고하십시오.\\n위키백과 내에서 정책과 지침 집행은 사회적 상호 작용과 비슷한 양상으로 흘러갑니다. 특정 편집자가 정책과 지침에 쓰여 있는 공동체의 총의를 어기는 경우 타 편집자가 처음에는 문서나 사용자 토론란에서 정책과 지침을 지켜달라고 요청할 수 있습니다. 시간이 지나도 지속적으로 위반한다면 관리자의 제재 요청이나 강제적인 수단에 맡길 수도 있지요.\\n특정 사용자가 공동체의 규범을 총체적으로 어기고 있다면 규범 준수를 위해 좀 더 빠르게 강력한 수단을 이용해야 합니다. 특히 정책 문서에 명시된 원칙을 지키지 않는 것은 대부분의 경우 다른 사용자에게 받아들여지지 않습니다 (다른 분들에게 예외 상황임을 설득할 수 있다면 가능하기는 하지만요). 이는 당신을 포함해서 편집자 개개인이 정책과 지침을 직접 집행 및 적용한다는 것을 의미합니다.\\n특정 사용자가 명백히 정책에 반하는 행동을 하거나 정책과 상충되는 방식으로 지침을 어기는 경우, 특히 의도적이고 지속적으로 그런 행위를 하는 경우 해당 사용자는 관리자의 제재 조치로 일시적, 혹은 영구적으로 편집이 차단될 수 있습니다. 영어판을 비롯한 타 언어판에서는 일반적인 분쟁 해결 절차로 끝낼 수 없는 사안은 중재위원회가 개입하기도 합니다.\\n\\n문서 내용\\n정책과 지침의 문서 내용은 처음 읽는 사용자라도 원칙과 규범을 잘 이해할 수 있도록 다음 원칙을 지켜야 합니다.\\n\\n명확하게 작성하세요. 소수만 알아듣거나 준법률적인 단어, 혹은 지나치게 단순한 표현은 피해야 합니다. 명확하고, 직접적이고, 모호하지 않고, 구체적으로 작성하세요. 지나치게 상투적인 표현이나 일반론은 피하세요. 지침, 도움말 문서 및 기타 정보문 문서에서도 \"해야 합니다\" 혹은 \"하지 말아야 합니다\" 같이 직접적인 표현을 굳이 꺼릴 필요는 없습니다.\\n가능한 간결하게, 너무 단순하지는 않게. 정책이 중언부언하면 오해를 부릅니다. 불필요한 말은 생략하세요. 직접적이고 간결한 설명이 마구잡이식 예시 나열보다 더 이해하기 쉽습니다. 각주나 관련 문서 링크를 이용하여 더 상세히 설명할 수도 있습니다.\\n규칙을 만든 의도를 강조하세요. 사용자들이 상식대로 행동하리라 기대하세요. 정책의 의도가 명료하다면, 추가 설명은 필요 없죠. 즉 규칙을 \\'어떻게\\' 지키는지와 더불어 \\'왜\\' 지켜야 하는지 확실하게 밝혀야 합니다.\\n범위는 분명히, 중복은 피하기. 되도록 앞부분에서 정책 및 지침의 목적과 범위를 분명하게 밝혀야 합니다. 독자 대부분은 도입부 초반만 읽고 나가버리니까요. 각 정책 문서의 내용은 해당 정책의 범위 내에서만 서술하세요. 한 도움말 문서가 다루는 범위가 다른 것과 겹친다면, 중복되는 부분을 최소화하세요. 한 정책 문서에서 다른 정책을 설명할 시, 최대한 간단명료하게만 작성해야 합니다.\\n과도한 링크는 피하세요. 타 정책, 지침, 수필, 기타 문서는 설명 또는 문맥상 필요할 시에만 링크해야 합니다. 다른 도움말 문서로 링크하는 것은 의도였든 아니든 해당 문서에 지나친 권위를 부여할 수 있습니다. 링크해도 되는 것과 안 되는 것을 명확히 해 주세요.\\n서로 모순되어서는 안 됩니다. 공동체의 관점이 \\'A면서 A가 아니다\\'로 모일 수는 없습니다. 각 문서 간 명백한 모순이 발견된다면, 편집자들은 관련 문서들에 토론을 열어 공동체의 현재 입장을 확실히 정하고, 그에 맞게 모든 문서를 재정리해야 합니다. 그 논의는 하나의 토론 장소에서만 열어야 하며, 영향을 받는 모든 문서의 토론란에 토론 진행중임을 알려야 합니다.\\n정책과 지침은 백과사전의 일부가 아닙니다\\n위키백과는 백과사전식 내용 관련 정책과 지침이 많이 있습니다. 위키백과의 내용 관련 규범은 확인 가능성, 중립성, 생존 인물 관련 존중, 그 외 여러 가치를 요구합니다.\\n하지만 정책, 지침, 및 기타 운영에 관련된 문서들은 위키백과 백과사전의 일부가 아닙니다. 즉 일반적인 문서와 같은 내용 정책이나 지침을 적용할 필요가 없습니다. 위키백과의 관리 관련 문서에 확인 가능한 출처를 인용해야 한다거나, 정책과 지침을 전부 중립적 어조로 작성해야 한다거나, 편집 지침을 외부 출처로 인용해야만 하는 것은 아닙니다. 대신 정책 관련 문서의 내용은 공동체에 적용되는 총의에 따르고, 작성 방식은 다른 사용자를 위한 명확성, 단순 명쾌함, 유용성에 중점을 둡니다.\\n다만 정책과 지침 문서도, 내용 관련 정책이 아닌 다른 규정은 준수해야 합니다. 예를 들어, 위키백과 내의 어떤 문서에서든 저작권 침해는 용납되지 않습니다. 편집 분쟁 역시 일반 문서든 아니든 금지됩니다.\\n\\n채택 과정\\n한국어 위키백과에서 오랫동안 확립되어 온 정책과 지침의 대다수는, 영어 위키백과 설립 시 토대가 된 원칙에서 발전된 것들입니다. 물론 타 언어 위키백과의 원칙을 가져오는 것 말고도, 정책과 지침을 일반적인 문제와 문서 훼손 행위의 대응책으로 한국어 위키백과 내 공동체에서 자발적으로 세우기도 했습니다. 정책과 지침 대부분은 전례 없이 바로 받아들여지기보다, 공동체의 강력한 지지를 바탕으로 세워집니다. 정책과 지침의 제정 방법으로는 제안을 통한 수립, 기존의 수필 또는 지침의 정책화, 기존의 정책과 지침의 분할 또는 합병을 통한 재구성 등의 여러 방법이 있습니다.\\n정책과 지침이 아닌 위키백과 내 운영과 관련된 문서에는 {{수필}}, {{정보문}}, {{위키백과 사용서}} 등을 붙여 구분해야 합니다.\\n현재 정책이나 지침으로 제안된 문서는 분류:위키백과 제안에 모여 있습니다. 총의를 통해 채택이 거부된 제안은 분류:위키백과 거부된 제안을 참조하세요. 여러분들의 참여를 환영합니다.\\n\\n제안과 채택\\n\\xa0백:아님 §\\xa0관료주의  문서를 참고하십시오. 단축백:제안\\n제안 문서란 정책과 지침으로 채택하자고 의견을 묻는 문서이나 아직 위키백과 내에 받아들여지는 원칙으로 확립되지는 않은 문서입니다. {{제안}} 틀을 붙여 공동체 내에서 정책이나 지침으로 채택할 지 의견을 물을 수 있습니다. 제안 문서는 정책과 지침이 아니므로 아무리 실제 있는 정책이나 지침을 요약하거나 인용해서 다른 문서에 쓴다고 해도 함부로 정책이나 지침 틀을 붙여서는 안 됩니다.\\n\\'제안\\'은 완전 새로운 원칙이라기보다, 기존의 불문율이나 토론 총의의 문서를 통한 구체화에 가깝습니다. 많은 사람들이 쉽게 제안을 받아들이도록 하기 위해서는, 기초적인 원칙을 우선 정하고 기본 틀을 짜야 합니다. 정책과 지침의 기본 원칙은 \"왜 지켜야 하는가?\", \"어떻게 지켜야 하는가?\" 두 가지입니다. 특정 원칙을 정책이나 지침으로 확립하기 위해서는 우선 저 두 가지 물음에 성실하게 답하는 제안 문서를 작성해야 합니다.\\n좋은 아이디어를 싣기 위해 사랑방이나 관련 위키프로젝트에 도움을 구해 피드백을 요청할 수 있습니다. 이 과정에서 공동체가 어느 정도 받아들일 수 있는 원칙이 구체화됩니다. 많은 이와의 토론을 통해 공감대가 형성되고 제안을 개선할 수 있습니다.\\n정책이나 지침은 위키백과 내의 모든 편집자들에게 적용되는 원칙이므로 높은 수준의 총의가 요구됩니다. 제안 문서가 잘 짜여졌고 충분히 논의되었다면, 더 많은 공동체의 편집자와 논의를 하기 위해 승격 제안을 올려야 합니다. 제안 문서 맨 위에 {{제안}}을 붙여 제안 안건임을 알려주고, 토론 문서에 {{의견 요청}}을 붙인 뒤 채택 제안에 관한 토론 문단을 새로 만들면 됩니다. 많은 편집자들에게 알리기 위해 관련 내용을 {{위키백과 소식}}에 올리고 사랑방에 이를 공지해야 하며, 합의가 있을 경우 미디어위키의 sitenotice(위키백과 최상단에 노출되는 구역)에 공지할 수도 있습니다. \\n차후 공지가 불충분했다는 이의 제기를 피하려면, 위의 링크를 이용하여 공지하세요. 공지에 비중립적인 단어를 사용하는 등의 선전 행위는 피하세요.\\n토론이 끝났다면 선언과 함께 {{토론보존}} 틀을 이용하여 닫습니다. 총의 판단은 여타 토론과 마찬가지로  분쟁 해결 정책에서 갈음해 처리합니다. 토론을 통해 정책이나 지침 채택 여부를 논의하며, 이 과정에서 제안 문서가 크게 수정될 수도 있습니다. 토론 중 제안을 정식 정책/지침으로 채택하자는 합의로 모이고 나서 2주 (정확히 14일. 이후 내용은 모두 같습니다) 간 제안을 대폭 수정해야 하는 변경안 제시나 명확한 근거가 존재하는 반대가 나오지 않는다면 정책이나 지침으로 정식으로 채택됩니다. 반대로 토론자들 사이에서 채택을 거부한다는 합의가 모아져서 2주간 명확한 근거가 존재하는 반대 의견이 나오지 않는다면 채택안 거부 총의가 모아졌다고 보아 기각됩니다. 주요한 총의 판단 기준은 다음과 같습니다. \\n\\n정책과 지침 관련 총의는 추세가 뚜렷해야 하지만, 만장일치일 필요는 없습니다.\\n제안 작성자 이외에도 공동체 전체에 노출되어 있어야 합니다.\\n제안 문서의 영향력을 고려하세요.\\n토론 중 중대한 문제가 제기되었는가?\\n다른 정책 또는 지침과 모순되지는 않는가?\\n새로 제정된 다른 정책 또는 지침과 병합될 수도 있는가?\\n이미 존재하는 정책 및 지침과 중복되지는 않는가?\\n제안 처리는 단순 득표수로 결정되지 않습니다. 투표는 토론을 대체하지 않으며, 득표수가 총의와 합치하는 것도 아닙니다.\\n총의가 불분명하고, 이 상황이 개선될 것 같지 않다면 이는 거부됩니다.\\n채택 토론은 세 가지로 귀결됩니다. 채택, 총의 없음, 거부.  토론 종결 이후 {{제안}} 틀을 제거하고 알맞은 틀을 삽입하세요. 가령 {{정책}}, {{지침}}, {{수필}}, {{거부}}  등을 말이죠. 그 외에 다양한 틀에는 위키백과 이름공간 관련 틀 (영어 위키백과)을 참고하세요.\\n제안이 통과되었다면, 위키백과:사랑방에 통과된 정책의 주요 내용을 정리해서 새 제안이 정책/지침화되었음을 공지해야 합니다. 제안이 거부되었다면 특별한 합의가 있지 않는 이상 {{거부}} 틀을 지우지 않습니다. 이후 문서 개선 등을 통해 새 규칙으로 발전할 수도 있고, 다른 정책 개정 시 논란이 없는 부분에 한해 도입되기도 되기도 하니까요.\\n\\n내용 변경\\n정책과 지침은 다른 위키백과 문서처럼 편집할 수 있습니다. 사전에 변경 사항을 논의하거나 문자화된 총의 기록를 구비할 필요는 없습니다. 그러나 정책과 지침은 민감하고 복잡합니다. 사용자들은 모든 편집 시 공동체의 관점을 충실히 반영하도록, 실수로 새로운 오류 또는 혼동의 원인이 발생하지 않도록 주의해야 합니다.\\n명심하세요. 정책과 지침의 목적은 대부분의 위키백과인들이 동의하는 바를 진술하는 것이고, 따라서 정책과 지침은 주제에 대한 현재의 총의를 반영해야 합니다. 정책/지침/수필 문서의 편집 자체가 허용되는 관례의 즉각적인 변경을 의미하지는 않습니다. 정책 또는 지침 문서에서 거부된 관행을 권장하는 것은 당연히 나쁜 활동입니다.\\n아래에서 보듯, 당신은 과감하게 삽입하거나, 토론을 통하여 광범위한 총의를 모으는 방식으로 모범적인 활동 규범을 제시할 수 있습니다.\\n\\n실질적인 변경\\n실행하세요. 정책 및 지침 문서를 실질적으로 변경하기 전에, 기존 관행에 대한 합리적인 예외를 설정하는 것이 유용할 수 있습니다. 이러한 방식으로 기존의 관행을 갱신하기 위해, 백:과감과 백:무시 정신에 따라 기존의 관행에서 직접적으로 벗어날 수도 있습니다. 시간이 지나고, 변경에 대한 이의가 없거나 토론을 통해 변경 또는 구현에 대한 광범위한 총의에 도달한 경우, 관행을 설명하는 정책 및 지침 문서를 편집하여 새로운 상황을 반영할 수 있습니다.\\n토론 먼저 하세요. 토론 문서 내 논의는 일반적으로 정책의 실질적인 변경보다 우선합니다. 이의가 없거나 토론에서 해당 변경에 대한 총의가 형성되었다면 변경할 수 있습니다. 서식, 문법 및 명료성 개선을 위한 사소한 편집은 언제든지 가능합니다.\\n논의 결과가 불분명할 경우 제안 과정에서처럼 관리자나 다른 독립 편집자가 평가해야 합니다. 주요한 변화들은 또한 일반적으로 지역사회에 공표되어야 합니다; 제안 과정과 유사한 발표가 적절할 수 있습니다.\\n더욱 폭넓은 참여가 필요하다면 {{새로운 토론|문단=진행 중인 토론 문단}} 틀이 유용할 수 있습니다. \\n또는 과감해지세요. 비록 편집자들 대부분이 (특히 잘 짜인 문서에서) 기존의 논의 기록을 찾지만, 이러한 문서를 직접 편집하는 것은 위키피디아의 정책에 의해 허용됩니다. 따라서 변경 전에 총의를 나타내는 정식 논의가 없었다는 이유만으로 변경 사항을 제거해서는 안 됩니다. 대신, 편집 요약이나 토론 문서에 실질적인 반박 이유를 제시해야 합니다.\\n정책 및 지침을 과감히 편집할 시 되돌리기를 당했다면 먼저 되돌리기 하는 것 보다, 토론을 열어 의견을 나누는 것이 좋습니다. 토론 중 자신의 주장을 뒷받침하기 위한 정책 편집은 체제를 시험하는 것으로 보일 수 있습니다. 특히 편집 시 논쟁에 자신이 참여한 사실을 밝히지 않았다면 더더욱이요.\\n\\n격하\\n특정 정책이나 지침이 편집 관행이나 공동체 규범이 바뀌며 쓸모없어질 수 있고, 다른 문서가 개선되어 내용이 중복될 수 있으며, 불필요한 내용이 증식할 수도 있습니다. 이 경우 편집자들은 정책을 지침으로 격하하거나, 정책 또는 지침을 보충 설명, 정보문, 수필 또는 중단 문서로 격하할 것을 제안할 수 있습니다. \\n격하 과정은 채택 과정과 비슷합니다. 일반적으로 토론 문서 내 논의가 시작되고 프로젝트 문서 상단에 {{새로운 토론|문단=진행 중인 토론 문단}} 틀을 붙여 공동체의 참여를 요청합니다. 논의가 충분히 이루어진 후, 제3의 편집자가 토론을 종료하고 평가한 후 상태 변경 총의가 형성되었는지 판단해야 합니다. 폐지된 정책이나 지침은 최상단에 {{중단}} 틀을 붙여 더 이상 사용하지 않는 정책/지침임을 알립니다.\\n소수의 공동체 인원만 지지하는 수필, 정보문 및 기타 비공식 문서는 일반적으로 주된 작성자의 사용자 이름공간으로 이동합니다. 이러한 논의는 일반적으로 해당 문서의 토론란에서 이루어지며, 간혹 위키백과:의견 요청을 통해 처리되기도 합니다.\\n\\n같이 보기\\n위키백과:위키백과의 정책과 지침 목록\\n위키백과:의견 요청\\n수필\\n\\n위키백과:제품, 절차, 정책\\n위키백과:위키백과 공동체의 기대와 규범\\n기타 링크\\n\\n위키백과:사랑방 (정책) - 현재는 폐지됨.\\n외부 링크\\n위키미디어 재단의
